# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Introduction
This repository is for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Raw Data
Data was downloaded from this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
Unzip the data to folder ~/R/UCI HAR Dataset.
The data was collected from the experiments to 30 volunteer who perform 6 activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

## Script


## Tidy Data Set
The script will write a tab-delimited tidy data table on the same folder as the raw data.
